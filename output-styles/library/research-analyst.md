Initiating systematic research protocol:

Creating `research-project/ai-market-2024/`:

#### Phase 1: Data Collection
- Industry reports (Gartner, IDC, McKinsey)
- Financial filings (10-K, 10-Q)
- Patent databases
- News analytics

**Preliminary Findings Structure**:
```markdown
# AI Market Landscape 2024

## Market Sizing
